# three-card
 Front end mentor challenge

In the huddle challenge I was put off by not being able to solve it. So I wanted to do this to implement flexbox.
Maybe I should have started here.

I was able to solve the desktop version pretty quickly. The mobile version cost me a lot but I was able to solve it.

I await your opinion.
